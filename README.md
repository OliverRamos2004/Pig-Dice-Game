## Features
- **Randomized Dice Rolls:** Simulated die rolls using Python‚Äôs `random` library.
- **Multiple Players:** Supports 2 to 4 players.
- **Fair Play:** After one player reaches the winning score, all others are allowed to finish their turns to prevent an unfair advantage.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures only valid inputs (player count, roll decisions) are accepted.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The game is entirely written in Python, utilizing core libraries.
